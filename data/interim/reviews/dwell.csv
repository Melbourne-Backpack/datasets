"one of the best student accommodations I have stayed in. It's a contemporary accommodation with all the facilities available a student might need.

"The access to the wifi service was not easy to use. Apparently, it was prepared to be used through a computer more than from the phone or on the TV. The apartment was very nice and comfortable. The heated swimming pool was fantastic!!! The staff was very friendly and always willing to solve any problem that we had.

"There was a bit of confusion when we were about to check in. The staff told us that they're only giving us 1 room and if we want another one, we need to pay for it. I showed her the booking details and confirmation however, she was not convinced until I spoke with another staff and explained that I had booked 2 rooms. Also, I forgot to check that there were no A/C in the room so we had to suffer in a 30+ degree in summer. Lol Movie room and pool. The room in the new building is clean.

"The reception was a bit confusing. We arrived for check-in around 8 pm and had to call after hours to have someone come out to meet us, and when we left, there was no one in reception yet and no one answered the after-hours call so check out was a bit confusing.The pool and the gym were fantastic. The location was so convenient and close to the city. The little village was just so cute and clean as well, especially for affordable accommodation!

There was no dish washing liquid or cloths to clean dishes. Great location. Ease of checking in and out. Good value. Stayed in December 2021,4,https://www.booking.com/reviews/au/hotel/dwell-village-melbourne-city.html,1
"Booking was made online but rang and spoke with managers twice about the girls being 17 with no one over 18 staying with them. A couple of days before they were due to arrive an email was received to say they were cancelling the booking. After a phone discussion with the manager, he reluctantly agreed to honour the booking. On arriving the girls were charged $11+ to use the Eftpos machine to pay for their stay and the bond. The room they were given was filthy and had no utensils, one pillow and the fridge didn't work. The key didn't work. After the first night, they spoke with a reception and she found them another room which was cleaner, had utensils, a toaster and a working fridge. Bond was received back after follow-up emails.The location was good.Stayed in January 2022",3,https://www.booking.com/reviews/au/hotel/dwell-village-melbourne-city.html,1

"We stayed at the Village during the Australian Open. The staff was very pleasant and keen to show us the facilities. Great location within walking distance to Lygon Street, University of Melbourne, Women.s Hospital. Tram stop almost at the door which made getting around extremely easy. Handy having cooking facilities including microwave and full-sized fridge.",5,https://www.expedia.com/Melbourne-And-Vicinity-Hotels-Dwell-Village-Melbourne-City.h16242558.Hotel-Reviews,1

"Went to Melbourne for 4 days and wanted to find a budget hotel near the CBD Found the RMIT village, wasn't sure about checking in to a place that provides both hotel/student accommodation services. Nevertheless, I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised. The location is absolutely fantastic, just 5mins on the tram to Burke St (probably 15mins walking). The staff is all very helpful and friendly as were the students who live onsite.",5,https://www.expedia.com/Melbourne-And-Vicinity-Hotels-Dwell-Village-Melbourne-City.h16242558.Hotel-Reviews,1
