A particular older man, presumably the head manager, went out of his way to be extremely rude and unrealistic in his asking. As I was waiting for a friend to come down from her room, in the lobby while holding my bicycle beside me, this man came out behind the front desk demanding me to either put my bike in my room immediately or wait outside with my bike. He claimed that one is not allowed to have a bike in the lobby at all. I asked what harm myself and my bike were causing to the facility or other people, and he replies extremely rudely with 'your opinion does not matter, those are the rules'. After re-examining the VU Resident Handbook, there is absolutely no evidence that states one can not wait in the lobby with a bicycle. This mans request was completely unrealistic, and his attitude was extremely uncalled for. His lack of professionalism and problem solving skills should be looked into by higher authority. I will most definitely be sharing my story!!!","rating":1,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unilodge.vu\/reviews","category_id":4},{"comment":"The room and the housemates are really terrible.

After feeling claustrophobic and disgusting at some left over dirt in the first room they assigned me they took me to three other rooms trying to find a great one. After a traumatic heat-related experience (will explain further below) I wrote an overly harsh review that didn't focus enough on the good points and instead of kicking me out or getting mad they understood I wasn't trying to hurt them, but simply inform people of the problem I faced, and offered to move me to a room that gets less sun in an attempt to help. I am now happily moved into that new room. No matter how much of a nuisance I've been or how many complaints I've brought up in only two weeks of staying here they have always greeted me with a smile and been helpful and understanding. They're extremely attentive and friendly. I've never seen staff that were so great!","rating":5,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unilodge.vu\/reviews","category_id":4},{"comment":"The rooms themselves are good, I have a regular studio on the 3rd floor so the view is fairly close to the ground but it's still a good view. I've never gotten a noise complaint despite watching the TV loudly and clattering a lot while doing the dishes and moving. I also haven't heard a peep from my neighbours. Outside can get a little loud, it's noisier on the cooler side of the building and on the hotter side you get to watch people play basketball (the one thing I really miss from that room). If you're large the bathroom may be a bit of a tight fit, but I'm about 26kg overweight and I'm really comfortable so there's definitely room. The showers don't have removable shower heads, they're fixed, and they don't have doors just curtains. So if you're like me and weren't used to that, just know it's not impossible to adapt haha. The kitchen has plenty of room, it's actually a pretty decent kitchen and the bed is a king single, which is bigger than my old bed so I was pretty happy. The bed jiggles a lot and you may need a mattress topper to be comfortable but test it out first to make sure, it isn't that bad. I got a topper and it's great with that. There's a TV and lots of room, really, for one person. You fill out a condition report when you first come, mention everything, loose handles, dirt, stains on walls, anything even minor with the room that you find is off and they'll come and fix it for you pretty quickly (provided people are available quickly, the maintenance guy was on break when I first arrived so it took a little longer to get stuff fixed, they'll tell you if something like that is going to happen though). The lamps get VERY hot though, so if you're contending with heat, use the overhead lights.","rating":3,"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unilodge.vu\/reviews","category_id":4},{"comment":"So far the residents seem nice, I haven't gotten any flaque.

Look online for other heat management stuff too. I bought a cheap portable evaporative cooler, stuck foil to the window to reflect the sun away from the room (shiny side out), got a pedestal fan, a spray bottle of cold water and Kogan cooling mats for my bed. There's other stuff you can do too like clothes that actively cool you off, you can find them online, or you make your own with thick water proof pockets sewn on a shirt with ice packs in the pockets. The heat is the only reason that one star is missing. It's only 25% of the year at most and it's during the time a lot of people go back home for the holidays so you shouldn't have to cope with it for too long, I just don't want you to have any illusions. The past few years this area has experienced heatwaves around the middle of summer, it gets very hot, and if a heat wave hits I want you guys to be ready.

I have acted onbehalf of international students before to stop preditory actions from landlords. I will take my time get advice and we shall see were this goes. too have no compassion dure in covid lock down will make this a true pleasure. there was law passed about lockdown and rental agreements. what makes you think you were above the law ? a peice of paper is only as good as the legislation behind it. so before everyone at your lodges learns about tenancy tribunal answer the question. If I am right and I think I am you will have to pay a lot of money back. I would also think a curent afair would love to hear about your actions dure in covid. truly amazing that you have stated your place online so others can see it including the tribunal and media. did you know the fine for not lodging a bond with the bond authority in victoria is around $16,000 per person? and it states that any money taken that is not rent as a holding fee incase of damages etc is a bond even if the landlord pretends it is not. I wonder what 16 grand multiplied by everyone you have had stay there would be ? do you lodge your bonds with the bond authority ? to all the people reviewing here did you get a recipet from the bond authority ? if not it is illegal too collect a fee for damages or unpaid rent for a room or apartment. I doubt we can classify you as a hotel as you have long term contracts.

The first few weeks started off well, but from the get go of meeting the people running the place it was clear that they had overarching power and were willing to abuse. Although no utility bills are paid here, this student accomodation is not coveted under housing victoria\/RTA which allows management to get away with alot EG: giving breaches out for silly reasons like attending parties. I stayed at unilodge vu for over a year. The main reason people like this venue is because of its safety, yet after I had stayed at the place for a year and was assaulted by a roommate I was told to leave as they had found a novelty \u2018bong\u2019 in my room, smoke detector covered up (I was painting in my room), and had a friend staying over a few nights without permission from the unilodge overlords. The unnamed person who assaulted me and bullied me for several months remains staying at unilodge (unilodge don\u2019t do background checks before allowing residents to move in). With that said, I can now happily say I am now renting in a share-house and while I have to pay utilities the rent is much cheaper and I can wash my clothes for free. Unilodge claim they provide support but for the 3 months of lockdown the only \u2018support\u2019 i was given living on my own was a phone call once every couple of weeks to make sure I hadn\u2019t shot myself yet. It\u2019s clear that Unilodge bottom line is more important than providing a safe, nurturing accommodation for young adults moving out of home as the violent person remains at unilodge as he agreed to move to a more expensive room. I will also be submitting this review to Consumer Affairs.","rating":2,"link":"https:\/\/au.oceaniabiz.com\/victoria\/unilodge-victoria-university-697074","category_id":4},{"comment":"The coffee at Tiernan Cafe was amazing!

Not only with other residents, but also with moths and all kinds of wired creatures. You will also share the kitchen with the sparrows. Besides, the heater is time limited, you have to remember to press the button every several hour to keep your room warm in winter. Plus, I don't know what's wrong with their fire alarm. It has rang about 10 times (3 time at midnight) since I moved here with no actual danger. The loud noise of the alarm seems more harmful then the fire threat, it mights hurts hearing.

Although his apartment is in a relatively well-maintained condition, I wouldn't be surprised if many of the other rooms available weren't. The building itself is not bad, but it's some of the people living inside this student accommodation where the problem lies. It seems as though they have no respect for the place or the other people living in it. Cleaners only come once a week, which wouldn't be all that bad if it weren't for the idiot\/inconsiderate tenants that decide it's okay to leave rubbish in the middle of the hallway (such as empty bottles and wrappers). It stays there for the entire week, and the owners of the rubbish happily walk past it day in and day out without a care. Even the lift has scrunched up papers and wrappers in it, I mean...seriously? The type of people that live here must be idiots. Last week the fire alarm went off and we were required to exit via the stairwell, we discovered to our horror that on one of the floors someone had continuously left their rubbish! Yes, bags upon piles of bags of rotting stinky rubbish! And no, it wasn't like papers and recycling items, it was real rubbish with rotting food etc. I have no idea who thinks it would be okay to leave rubbish in a stairwell, not only is it a fire hazard (because it was blocking half the platform), but it's plain stupid and shows the lack of care some of these tenants have for the place.If this place managed to get rid of the retards, it would be very livable.

I will start with the positives of my time here, for one thing, the social atmosphere was fun and friendly, and sometimes quite rowdy and loud, which may be a deal breaker or a deal maker depending on who you are. One thing that was quite strange was that many of the residents were a lot older and were not students, despite Unilodge being 'exclusive' to university students. This was no bother to anyone, I would say it was more their loss, having to put up with all the young 18- 20 somethings running around.Back to the positives, it's a lovely building, it has a lovely view of chapel street and it is cleaned regularly. However, that being said be prepared to be woken up at 8 or 9 in the morning once a week by the cleaning lady banging her vacuum against your door as she cleans the halls.My room was a 'large' studio with balcony, and as I will admit it was a little bigger than the smaller ones, it was still very, very small. For the price of $1,063 dollars a month, they are really taking advantage of people who need to live there but can hardly afford it. However, all student accommodation is a rip off, so I wont hold that against them. I do not recommend getting a balcony, for the added price it was relatively useless, too small to even sit outside. I only ever used it for temporarily storing full rubbish bags until I went downstairs to the bins.Another thing that is a complete rip off is the lock out fee, I believe it was around $40 during the day time to get back in the room and $80 at night. And by night I mean later than 5PM. Over the corse of the year I ended up paying around $200 in lockout fees, when only getting locked out three times. Its not like its a terrible burden on any of the staff to unlock our door, literally all they would do is come out of their room, a floor down go up the elevator and unlock my door with their master key. AFTER of course, I signed a contract saying I will pay them $80. If the RA happens to be out at work or Uni when you are locked out your only option is to go to the Carlton office and pick up a spare key, which is around 30 minutes each way on a tram.From the very beginning, I had problems with the staff at Unilodge. They did not bother to make sure all my furniture was there when I moved in, I was missing a desk chair and a lounge chair. So essentially, I had no chairs in my 'fully furnished apartment'. I didn't mind at the time, I put it in a report and called them about it too. They promised to send it in the next week, but they did not. I called them 2 more times after, and never did I get the furniture I was meant to get.Another thing all students got was a swipe key to get in the building and into the bin area, they didn't give me one with my other keys, saying they had to order more and I would get mine shortly. I didn't. Not that it was an issue getting in, I could use my master key, but when going to the bins I couldn't get back into the building. Each and every time, I would have to go back out onto the street and back in through the front door again, and it got very infuriating. I asked countless times for a swipe key, they said they would send me one, they are ordering more in etc ect. In fact when I resigned my lease, the office lady told me \\We should have some in soon","rating":2,"link":"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/unilodge-740-carlton-3","category_id":2},{"comment":"Unilodge has charged me the wrong monthly rent since the day I moved.
