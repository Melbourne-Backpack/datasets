"Friendly staff, convenient location near Victoria Uni Footscray campus, bus stop and tram station.",5,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
I stay here for 2 year and it make me feel home. Safe and clean.,5,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
I makes a lot of friend here too and having a lot of happy memories here.,5,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
The staff is very polite and gentle specially Sheetu and Jordan who are always there to help whenever we need  it . The location is ideal close to uni and transport . It’s highly recommended,5,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
"5 Star service experience here at UniLodge @ VU. I wouldnt recommend you stay anywhere else. Great staff, great vibe and a really nice Great Greek Manager. Awesome stuff UniLodge.",5,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
The management is really terrible and there is no air conditioner in the summer. It isn’t worth to pay here.,1,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
"The management at UniLodge is appalling to say the least! A particular older man, presumably the head manager, went out of his way to be extremely rude and unrealistic in his asking. As I was waiting for a friend to come down from her room, in the lobby while holding my bicycle beside me, this man came out behind the front desk demanding me to either put my bike in my room immediately or wait outside with my bike. He claimed that one is not allowed to have a bike in the lobby at all. I asked what harm myself and my bike were causing to the facility or other people, and he replies extremely rudely with 'your opinion does not matter, those are the rules'. After re-examining the VU Resident Handbook, there is absolutely no evidence that states one can not wait in the lobby with a bicycle. This mans request was completely unrealistic, and his attitude was extremely uncalled for. His lack of professionalism and problem solving skills should be looked into by higher authority. I will most definitely be sharing my story!!!",1,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
The room and the housemates are really terrible. Their management and the way to solve the problem was awful. Their staff and manager can do nothing for you when we need help. It's  not worth to pay the money to live here since they tend to ignore your right.,1,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
"Highly recommend this place to anyone. So close to Uni, the train station and the city worth every cent",5,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
"The staff are extremely nice and very helpful people. After feeling claustrophobic and disgusting at some left over dirt in the first room they assigned me they took me to three other rooms trying to find a great one. After a traumatic heat-related experience (will explain further below) I wrote an overly harsh review that didn't focus enough on the good points and instead of kicking me out or getting mad they understood I wasn't trying to hurt them, but simply inform people of the problem I faced, and offered to move me to a room that gets less sun in an attempt to help. I am now happily moved into that new room. No matter how much of a nuisance I've been or how many complaints I've brought up in only two weeks of staying here they have always greeted me with a smile and been helpful and understanding. They're extremely attentive and friendly. I've never seen staff that were so great!",5,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
"The rooms themselves are good, I have a regular studio on the 3rd floor so the view is fairly close to the ground but it's still a good view. I've never gotten a noise complaint despite watching the TV loudly and clattering a lot while doing the dishes and moving. I also haven't heard a peep from my neighbours. Outside can get a little loud, it's noisier on the cooler side of the building and on the hotter side you get to watch people play basketball (the one thing I really miss from that room). If you're large the bathroom may be a bit of a tight fit, but I'm about 26kg overweight and I'm really comfortable so there's definitely room. The showers don't have removable shower heads, they're fixed, and they don't have doors just curtains. So if you're like me and weren't used to that, just know it's not impossible to adapt haha. The kitchen has plenty of room, it's actually a pretty decent kitchen and the bed is a king single, which is bigger than my old bed so I was pretty happy. The bed jiggles a lot and you may need a mattress topper to be comfortable but test it out first to make sure, it isn't that bad. I got a topper and it's great with that. There's a TV and lots of room, really, for one person. You fill out a condition report when you first come, mention everything, loose handles, dirt, stains on walls, anything even minor with the room that you find is off and they'll come and fix it for you pretty quickly (provided people are available quickly, the maintenance guy was on break when I first arrived so it took a little longer to get stuff fixed, they'll tell you if something like that is going to happen though). The lamps get VERY hot though, so if you're contending with heat, use the overhead lights.",3,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,`
"So far the residents seem nice, I haven't gotten any flaque. The town is scary and new but I haven't encountered any trouble there either so far. Just be cautious at night, like anywhere else. The Unilodge is right next to a bus and tram stop and the train station has bus stops and tram stops right across the road, so if you need to get somewhere and it's too late or hot to walk public transport is right there. Parking is pretty big too, but I dunno how easy it is to get a spot or how much it is because I don't own a car. Sorry.",4,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
"Unilodge@VU is by far the best affordable student accommodation near Melbourne, only three stops from Southern Cross Station and apparently close to Highpoint (I've never been but I've heard from others). There's also a HUGE Coles and K-Mart about a 20 minute walk away, at most, and an IGA in the other direction (near a McDonald's, shh).",5,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
"Note though, the rooms do not have air conditioning, if you're like me and suffer anxiety and heat stroke you may want to specifically ask for a room that doesn't get much sun. Look online for other heat management stuff too. I bought a cheap portable evaporative cooler, stuck foil to the window to reflect the sun away from the room (shiny side out), got a pedestal fan, a spray bottle of cold water and Kogan cooling mats for my bed. There's other stuff you can do too like clothes that actively cool you off, you can find them online, or you make your own with thick water proof pockets sewn on a shirt with ice packs in the pockets. The heat is the only reason that one star is missing. It's only 25% of the year at most and it's during the time a lot of people go back home for the holidays so you shouldn't have to cope with it for too long, I just don't want you to have any illusions. The past few years this area has experienced heatwaves around the middle of summer, it gets very hot, and if a heat wave hits I want you guys to be ready. If you really love the heat then you're in luck, there's heaters in every room and summer can get hot lol.",3,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
"I hope you guys enjoy it here regardless, they have so many events each month to meet new people and get free food and there's a freakin' basketball court! Plus, no bills, the rent covers all your costs, I still don't really know how to pay it because I'm independent for the first time but I only have to worry about one thing instead of fifteen bazillion things. One or two things, I can't remember, at most two. So relax and enjoy it here, and if anything's wrong say so, ask for help. They can't fix a problem they don't know about. If you're in a hot room ask if you can move to a cooler one. If your room is filthy, ask them to clean it. It's ok, they'll do what they can. : )",4,https://www.facebook.com/unilodge.vu/reviews,4,,
"lets say any boarding house in victoria… lets say any boarding house in victoria as I know the legislation there and have had a bit too do with the tribunal system there. of course your answer was to divert. making me think I am right. either that your you have found a loop hole to take advantage of the weak poor and disadvantaged. international students will not know about this and most 18 year olds and there parents who either rent there own property or own would not know it. I have acted onbehalf of international students before to stop preditory actions from landlords. I will take my time get advice and we shall see were this goes. too have no compassion dure in covid lock down will make this a true pleasure. there was law passed about lockdown and rental agreements. what makes you think you were above the law ? a peice of paper is only as good as the legislation behind it. so before everyone at your lodges learns about tenancy tribunal answer the question. If I am right and I think I am you will have to pay a lot of money back. I would also think a curent afair would love to hear about your actions dure in covid. truly amazing that you have stated your place online so others can see it including the tribunal and media. did you know the fine for not lodging a bond with the bond authority in victoria is around $16,000 per person? and it states that any money taken that is not rent as a holding fee incase of damages etc is a bond even if the landlord pretends it is not. I wonder what 16 grand multiplied by everyone you have had stay there would be ? do you lodge your bonds with the bond authority ? to all the people reviewing here did you get a recipet from the bond authority ? if not it is illegal too collect a fee for damages or unpaid rent for a room or apartment. I doubt we can classify you as a hotel as you have long term contracts. I have never heard of you being put too the test. it will be interesting to see the outcome.",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/unilodge.com.au,4,,
"Unilodge on Riversdale Road, Melbourne, Victoria. Unilodge on Riversdale road, Melbourne, VIC 3122 is the horrible place with the worse managment ever. They have students as RA to help out the tenants but they select students as RA that they smoke in their apartments while they have already deactivated fire alarms, and party till morning and make noises and bother neighbours.  If you contact manager, they just ignore.  Just avoid the Unilodge in Melbourne.",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/unilodge.com.au,4,,
"Unilodge illegal coronavirus Isent my daughter to stay with unilodge during coronavirus and they way they handled it is disgusting. My daughter was not allowed to have any visitor in the building even her parents but there are staff coming in every day bringing the virus into the building and putting everyone in danger!!! My daughter asked one of the staff if she could have a meeting with her (apparently this person in charge of welfare!!!) and she said that they were only doing zoom. Then why are they coming into the building every day and I am not allowed to have dinner with my daughter,?? If only doing zoom meetings then why not work from home?? Unilodge is illegal and dangerous and should be sending staff in VICtoria home like everyone else and letting my daughter have the welfare she needs by seeing me",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/unilodge.com.au,4,,
"BEWARE FAKE REVIEWS/ REVIEWS BY NAIVE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS / UNILODGE STAFF I wish could say my experience at unilodge was positive, I really do. The first few weeks started off well, but from the get go of meeting the people running the place it was clear that they had overarching power and were willing to abuse. Although no utility bills are paid here, this student accomodation is not coveted under housing victoria/RTA which allows management to get away with alot EG: giving breaches out for silly reasons like attending parties. I stayed at unilodge vu for over a year. The main reason people like this venue is because of its safety, yet after I had stayed at the place for a year and was assaulted by a roommate I was told to leave as they had found a novelty ‘bong’ in my room, smoke detector covered up (I was painting in my room), and had a friend staying over a few nights without permission from the unilodge overlords. The unnamed person who assaulted me and bullied me for several months remains staying at unilodge (unilodge don’t do background checks before allowing residents to move in). With that said, I can now happily say I am now renting in a share-house and while I have to pay utilities the rent is much cheaper and I can wash my clothes for free. Unilodge claim they provide support but for the 3 months of lockdown the only ‘support’ i was given living on my own was a phone call once every couple of weeks to make sure I hadn’t shot myself yet. It’s clear that Unilodge bottom line is more important than providing a safe, nurturing accommodation for young adults moving out of home as the violent person remains at unilodge as he agreed to move to a more expensive room. I will also be submitting this review to Consumer Affairs.",2,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
The coffee at Tiernan Cafe was amazing! You can tell the barista takes great care when making your coffee.,5,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
My experience living here started out well but after time it was less enjoyable. Not cheap.,3,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
"Have been a UnilodgeVU Resident since a long time now and can say it is the best place for a student to reside, not only because they provide you with an excellent service and place to stay but also they support and take care of you like a family. I highly recommend staying at UnilodgeVU!",5,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
"The management at Unilodge VU show a lack of empathy and understanding for students, especially as we go through these extremely stressful times during exams and the fact that we are currently in a global pandemic.there have been unannounced visits from staff into rooms which breaches their own contract and shows the lack of professionality that the management provides.living at this accommodation feels more like a prison cell rather than the enjoyable uni lifestyle it should be.",1,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
"Reception always call me all the time, call me when I'm in class, call me when I'm at work, call me when I'm sleeping, I'm sick and tired of it",1,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
I've been living here for a year and a half now. The thing I like the most about this place is that they take mental health very seriously and regularly check with their residents. The staff were very supportive and helpful during the pandemic. Amazing place to live!,5,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
"Its been more than a Year in Melbourne as well as in Unilodge @ VU and I have never shifted to other places. Reason being the facilities provided on cheaper rates. For international students, bearing expenses of rent is really tough. I am paying the same amount what my other friends are paying and the best part is the events which occurs every week, you will get lots of friends to interact and network with.",5,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
"Been here for almost 2 years now and I just love everything about the place. The half basketball court, common area with the pool table, cinema room, study rooms, outdoor spaces and the furnished apartment are just amazing. Furthermore, the staff here at Unilodge are so friendly, kind and always make sure that everyone is safe and enjoy their stay here. I came here as an international student in 2019 and apart from missing home, I have met friends from all over the world and had the best experience in my life here at Unilodge. So proud to call this place home away from home.",5,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
A place with very friendly atmosphere and convenience. Made life so much easier during the pandemic. Love the latest green initiatives and the variety of community spirit programs that cater to the taste of everyone.,5,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
Overall the experience was great. I would strongly recommend VU Unilodge to those international students who are newly finding accomodations in footscray. It is safer and you will be taken care of.,5,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
"Friendly staffs. Always ready to find new ways to help us, specially during the lockdown, they kept us entertained with their events.",5,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
"The accommodation itself is a good place to live in, with easy access to Victoria University. The problems in the place mainly comes from having a noisy roommate, the laundry fee for the machine only accepts 1 or 2 dollar coins, and the random interval fire drills that sometimes happens during the most inconvenient of times. But other than that, the staff are usually quite helpful and amicable.",3,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
Very friendly atmosphere for students with great support from the staff! Makes sure that the stay here is comfortable with good attention given to cleanliness. Would definitely recommend:),5,https://au.oceaniabiz.com/victoria/unilodge-victoria-university-697074,4,,
