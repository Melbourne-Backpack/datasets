"HORRIBLE...I've been living with cockroaches for months (actually I saw one at night of the first day I moved in after I've signed the contract)... I talked to the management while they heartlessly asked me to buy pest control myself with a smiling face. And today I saw mice...Also, the bathroom is shared. Not only with other residents, but also with moths and all kinds of wired creatures. You will also share the kitchen with the sparrows. Besides, the heater is time limited, you have to remember to press the button every several hour to keep your room warm in winter. Plus, I don't know what's wrong with their fire alarm. It has rang about 10 times (3 time at midnight) since I moved here with no actual danger. The loud noise of the alarm seems more harmful then the fire threat, it mights hurts hearing. Moreover, the internet is not only expensive ($39.95 for 30000 MB) but also INCONTINENCE . It allow you to connect ONLY ONE device at a time. So if you want to use internet on tablet while your laptop is connected to the line, you have to: first, login to the portal on your tablet; second, select the disconnect button in the portal for your laptop; third, re-login to the portal; forth, select connect button in the portal for your tablet.I can write even more complaints for this horrible accommodation....The rent is $1083 per month for a single room.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/unilodge-740-carlton-3,2
"My partner lives in this building so I'm constantly in and out of the place. Although his apartment is in a relatively well-maintained condition, I wouldn't be surprised if many of the other rooms available weren't. The building itself is not bad, but it's some of the people living inside this student accommodation where the problem lies. It seems as though they have no respect for the place or the other people living in it. Cleaners only come once a week, which wouldn't be all that bad if it weren't for the idiot/inconsiderate tenants that decide it's okay to leave rubbish in the middle of the hallway (such as empty bottles and wrappers). It stays there for the entire week, and the owners of the rubbish happily walk past it day in and day out without a care. Even the lift has scrunched up papers and wrappers in it, I mean...seriously? The type of people that live here must be idiots. Last week the fire alarm went off and we were required to exit via the stairwell, we discovered to our horror that on one of the floors someone had continuously left their rubbish! Yes, bags upon piles of bags of rotting stinky rubbish! And no, it wasn't like papers and recycling items, it was real rubbish with rotting food etc. I have no idea who thinks it would be okay to leave rubbish in a stairwell, not only is it a fire hazard (because it was blocking half the platform), but it's plain stupid and shows the lack of care some of these tenants have for the place.If this place managed to get rid of the retards, it would be very livable. For now, we just put up with the sights and smells and pray whoever doing it gets struck by lighting.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/unilodge-740-carlton-3,2
If only they were as diligent with settling urgent repairs as they are when bombarding you with multiple reminders for rental payment on a different platform. overall the place is still liveable and the location is good. But don't ever count on the management here.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/unilodge-740-carlton-3,2
"In 2013 I took a 12 month lease with UniLodge, at the building on Raleigh Street. I will start with the positives of my time here, for one thing, the social atmosphere was fun and friendly, and sometimes quite rowdy and loud, which may be a deal breaker or a deal maker depending on who you are. One thing that was quite strange was that many of the residents were a lot older and were not students, despite Unilodge being 'exclusive' to university students. This was no bother to anyone, I would say it was more their loss, having to put up with all the young 18- 20 somethings running around.Back to the positives, it's a lovely building, it has a lovely view of chapel street and it is cleaned regularly. However, that being said be prepared to be woken up at 8 or 9 in the morning once a week by the cleaning lady banging her vacuum against your door as she cleans the halls.My room was a 'large' studio with balcony, and as I will admit it was a little bigger than the smaller ones, it was still very, very small. For the price of $1,063 dollars a month, they are really taking advantage of people who need to live there but can hardly afford it. However, all student accommodation is a rip off, so I wont hold that against them. I do not recommend getting a balcony, for the added price it was relatively useless, too small to even sit outside. I only ever used it for temporarily storing full rubbish bags until I went downstairs to the bins.Another thing that is a complete rip off is the lock out fee, I believe it was around $40 during the day time to get back in the room and $80 at night. And by night I mean later than 5PM. Over the corse of the year I ended up paying around $200 in lockout fees, when only getting locked out three times. Its not like its a terrible burden on any of the staff to unlock our door, literally all they would do is come out of their room, a floor down go up the elevator and unlock my door with their master key. AFTER of course, I signed a contract saying I will pay them $80. If the RA happens to be out at work or Uni when you are locked out your only option is to go to the Carlton office and pick up a spare key, which is around 30 minutes each way on a tram.From the very beginning, I had problems with the staff at Unilodge. They did not bother to make sure all my furniture was there when I moved in, I was missing a desk chair and a lounge chair. So essentially, I had no chairs in my 'fully furnished apartment'. I didn't mind at the time, I put it in a report and called them about it too. They promised to send it in the next week, but they did not. I called them 2 more times after, and never did I get the furniture I was meant to get.Another thing all students got was a swipe key to get in the building and into the bin area, they didn't give me one with my other keys, saying they had to order more and I would get mine shortly. I didn't. Not that it was an issue getting in, I could use my master key, but when going to the bins I couldn't get back into the building. Each and every time, I would have to go back out onto the street and back in through the front door again, and it got very infuriating. I asked countless times for a swipe key, they said they would send me one, they are ordering more in etc ect. In fact when I resigned my lease, the office lady told me \We should have some in soon",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/unilodge-740-carlton-3,2
"Unilodge has charged me the wrong monthly rent since the day I moved. Every time I paid the figure i was told for the month, (monthly rent changes according to number of days in a month). However when i ask about how much i have to pay the following month. They tell me I still have rent owning for the previous month. How is that possible when i paid the exact figure they asked me to.Every time i went to confront management about g this issue, just so they would get the amount right each time they would say they are currently looking into it as a way of stalling the settlement of the issue.All in all, they are never accountable with your money, charge you for everything possible, and would put all blame on you just so they do not have to bear any responsibility or incur any charges.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/unilodge-740-carlton-3,2
"Pros: Very good location, close proximity to public transport, groceries, restaurants, and university. The receptionist and residential advisors are very kind and helpful. There are cleaners cleaning the common area every day. 
Cons: Most of the facilities are rather old and constantly require maintenance. The rooms were quite spacious but have very thin walls and very bad soundproofing. Good luck trying to get a good sleep if you have an inconsiderate neighbor. Conclusion: For the cheap price I was paying, ",3,https://nicelocal.com.au/melbourne/realty/unilodge_melbourne_-_university_accommodation/,2

"The building has banned visitors to enter this building.

"I would give them 2—3 stars.
