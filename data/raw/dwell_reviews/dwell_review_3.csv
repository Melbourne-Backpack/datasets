"The property has no aircon but the fan was ok"
"We stayed at the Village during the Australian Open. Staff were very pleasant and keen to show us the facilities. Great location within walking distance to Lygon Street, University of Melbourne, Women.s Hospital. Tram stop almost at the door which made getting around extremely easy. Handy having cooking facilities including microwave and full-sized fridge."
"Free Wifi would of been nice"
"10min walk to free tram. No housekeeping. not really worth the money."
"Went to Melbourne for 4 days and wanted to find a budget hotel near the CBD Found the RMIT village, wasn't sure about checking into a place which provides both hotel/student accommodation services. Nevertheless I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised. The location is absolutely fantastic, just 5mins on the tram to Burke St (probably15mins walking). The staff are all very helpful and friendly as were the students who live onsite."
