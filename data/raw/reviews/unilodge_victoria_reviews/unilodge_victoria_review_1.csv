"Friendly staff, convenient location near Victoria Uni Footscray campus, bus stop and tram station."
"I stay here for 2 year and it make me feel home. Safe and clean."
"I makes a lot of friend here too and having a lot of happy memories here."
"Thank you Unilodge@VU"
"The staff is very polite and gentle specially Sheetu and Jordan who are always there to help whenever we need  it . The location is ideal close to uni and transport . It’s highly recommended"
"5 Star service experience here at UniLodge @ VU. I wouldnt recommend you stay anywhere else. Great staff, great vibe and a really nice Great Greek Manager. Awesome stuff UniLodge."
"The management is really terrible and there is no air conditioner in the summer. It isn’t worth to pay here."
"The management at UniLodge is appalling to say the least! A particular older man, presumably the head manager, went out of his way to be extremely rude and unrealistic in his asking. As I was waiting for a friend to come down from her room, in the lobby while holding my bicycle beside me, this man came out behind the front desk demanding me to either put my bike in my room immediately or wait outside with my bike. He claimed that one is not allowed to have a bike in the lobby at all. I asked what harm myself and my bike were causing to the facility or other people, and he replies extremely rudely with 'your opinion does not matter, those are the rules'. After re-examining the VU Resident Handbook, there is absolutely no evidence that states one can not wait in the lobby with a bicycle. This mans request was completely unrealistic, and his attitude was extremely uncalled for. His lack of professionalism and problem solving skills should be looked into by higher authority. I will most definitely be sharing my story!!!"
"The room and the housemates are really terrible. Their management and the way to solve the problem was awful. Their staff and manager can do nothing for you when we need help. It's  not worth to pay the money to live here since they tend to ignore your right."
"Highly recommend this place to anyone. So close to Uni, the train station and the city worth every cent"
"The staff are extremely nice and very helpful people. After feeling claustrophobic and disgusting at some left over dirt in the first room they assigned me they took me to three other rooms trying to find a great one. After a traumatic heat related experience (will explain further below) I wrote an overly harsh review that didn't focus enough on the good points and instead of kicking me out or getting mad they understood I wasn't trying to hurt them, but simply inform people of the problem I faced, and offered to move me to a room that gets less sun in an attempt to help. I am now happily moved into that new room. No matter how much of a nuisance I've been or how many complaints I've brought up in only two weeks of staying here they have always greeted me with a smile and been helpful and understanding. They're extremely attentive and friendly. I've never seen staff that were so great!"
"The rooms themselves are good, I have a regular studio on the 3rd floor so the view is fairly close to the ground but it's still a good view. I've never gotten a noise complaint despite watching the TV loudly and clattering a lot while doing the dishes and moving. I also haven't heard a peep from my neighbours. Outside can get a little loud, it's noisier on the cooler side of the building and on the hotter side you get to watch people play basketball (the one thing I really miss from that room). If you're large the bathroom may be a bit of a tight fit, but I'm about 26kg overweight and I'm really comfortable so there's definitely room. The showers don't have removable shower heads, they're fixed, and they don't have doors just curtains. So if you're like me and weren't used to that, just know it's not impossible to adapt haha. The kitchen has plenty of room, it's actually a pretty decent kitchen and the bed is a king single, which is bigger than my old bed so I was pretty happy. The bed jiggles a lot and you may need a mattress topper to be comfortable but test it out first to make sure, it isn't that bad. I got a topper and it's great with that. There's a TV and lots of room, really, for one person. You fill out a condition report when you first come, mention everything, loose handles, dirt, stains on walls, anything even minor with the room that you find is off and they'll come and fix it for you pretty quickly (provided people are available quickly, the maintenance guy was on break when I first arrived so it took a little longer to get stuff fixed, they'll tell you if something like that is going to happen though). The lamps get VERY hot though, so if you're contending with heat, use the overhead lights."
"So far the residents seem nice, I haven't gotten any flaque. The town is scary and new but I haven't encountered any trouble there either so far. Just be cautious at night, like anywhere else. The Unilodge is right next to a bus and tram stop and the train station has bus stops and tram stops right across the road, so if you need to get somewhere and it's too late or hot to walk public transport is right there. Parking is pretty big too, but I dunno how easy it is to get a spot or how much it is because I don't own a car. Sorry."
"Unilodge@VU is by far the best affordable student accommodation near Melbourne, only three stops from Southern Cross Station and apparently close to Highpoint (I've never been but I've heard from others). There's also a HUGE Coles and K-Mart about a 20 minute walk away, at most, and an IGA in the other direction (near a McDonald's, shh)."
"Note though, the rooms do not have air conditioning, if you're like me and suffer anxiety and heat stroke you may want to specifically ask for a room that doesn't get much sun. Look online for other heat management stuff too. I bought a cheap portable evaporative cooler, stuck foil to the window to reflect the sun away from the room (shiny side out), got a pedestal fan, a spray bottle of cold water and Kogan cooling mats for my bed. There's other stuff you can do too like clothes that actively cool you off, you can find them online, or you make your own with thick water proof pockets sewn on a shirt with ice packs in the pockets. The heat is the only reason that one star is missing. It's only 25% of the year at most and it's during the time a lot of people go back home for the holidays so you shouldn't have to cope with it for too long, I just don't want you to have any illusions. The past few years this area has experienced heatwaves around the middle of summer, it gets very hot, and if a heat wave hits I want you guys to be ready. If you really love the heat then you're in luck, there's heaters in every room and summer can get hot lol."
"I hope you guys enjoy it here regardless, they have so many events each month to meet new people and get free food and there's a freakin' basketball court! Plus, no bills, the rent covers all your costs, I still don't really know how to pay it because I'm independent for the first time but I only have to worry about one thing instead of fifteen bajillion things. One or two things, I can't remember, at most two. So relax and enjoy it here, and if anything's wrong say so, ask for help. They can't fix a problem they don't know about. If you're in a hot room ask if you can move to a cooler one. If your room is filthy, ask them to clean it. It's ok, they'll do what they can. : )"
