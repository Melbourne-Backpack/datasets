"BEWARE FAKE REVIEWS/ REVIEWS BY NAIVE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS / UNILODGE STAFF\n\nI wish could say my experience at unilodge was positive, I really do. The first few weeks started off well, but from the get go of meeting the people running the place it was clear that they had overarching power and were willing to abuse. Although no utility bills are paid here, this student accomodation is not coveted under housing victoria/RTA which allows management to get away with alot EG: giving breaches out for silly reasons like attending parties. I stayed at unilodge vu for over a year. The main reason people like this venue is because of its safety, yet after I had stayed at the place for a year and was assaulted by a roommate I was told to leave as they had found a novelty ‘bong’ in my room, smoke detector covered up (I was painting in my room), and had a friend staying over a few nights without permission from the unilodge overlords. The unnamed person who assaulted me and bullied me for several months remains staying at unilodge (unilodge don’t do background checks before allowing residents to move in). With that said, I can now happily say I am now renting in a share-house and while I have to pay utilities the rent is much cheaper and I can wash my clothes for free. Unilodge claim they provide support but for the 3 months of lockdown the only ‘support’ i was given living on my own was a phone call once every couple of weeks to make sure I hadn’t shot myself yet. It’s clear that Unilodge bottom line is more important than providing a safe, nurturing accommodation for young adults moving out of home as the violent person remains at unilodge as he agreed to move to a more expensive room. I will also be submitting this review to Consumer Affairs.","william","15 July 2021 20:05"

"Have been a UnilodgeVU Resident since a long time now and can say it is the best place for a student to reside, not only because they provide you with an excellent service and place to stay but also they support and take care of you like a family. I highly recommend staying at UnilodgeVU!","Nandini","23 December 2020 9:36"
"The management at Unilodge VU show a lack of empathy and understanding for students, especially as we go through these extremely stressful times during exams and the fact that we are currently in a global pandemic.there have been unannounced visits from staff into rooms which breaches their own contract and shows the lack of professionality that the management provides.living at this accommodation feels more like a prison cell rather than the enjoyable uni lifestyle it should be.","Phineas","21 December 2020 10:56"
"Reception always call me all the time, call me when I'm in class, call me when I'm at work, call me when I'm sleeping, I'm sick and tired of it","冯佳璇","16 December 2020 19:29"
"I've been living here for a year and a half now. The thing I like the most about this place is that they take mental health very seriously and regularly check with their residents. The staff were very supportive and helpful during the pandemic. Amazing place to live!","NAVEEN","29 November 2020 17:33"
"Its been more than a Year in Melbourne as well as in Unilodge @ VU and I have never shifted to other places. Reason being the facilities provided on cheaper rates. For international students, bearing expenses of rent is really tough. I am paying the same amount what my other friends are paying and the best part is the events which occurs every week, you will get lots of friends to interact and network with.","Abhishek","26 November 2020 23:02"
"Been here for almost 2 years now and I just love everything about the place. The half basketball court, common area with the pool table, cinema room, study rooms, outdoor spaces and the furnished apartment are just amazing. Furthermore, the staff here at Unilodge are so friendly, kind and always make sure that everyone is safe and enjoy their stay here.\nI came here as an international student in 2019 and apart from missing home, I have met friends from all over the world and had the best experience in my life here at Unilodge. So proud to call this place home away from home.","Newton","18 November 2020 2:31"

"Overall the experience was great. I would strongly recommend VU Unilodge to those international students who are newly finding accomodations in footscray. It is safer and you will be taken care of.","Dhiviya","24 October 2020 13:05"
"Friendly staffs. Always ready to find new ways to help us, specially during the lockdown, they kept us entertained with their events.","Varsha","20 October 2020 16:11"
"The accommodation itself is a good place to live in, with easy access to Victoria University. The problems in the place mainly comes from having a noisy roommate, the laundry fee for the machine only accepts 1 or 2 dollar coins, and the random interval fire drills that sometimes happens during the most inconvenient of times. But other than that, the staff are usually quite helpful and amicable.","Vincent","15 October 2020 0:03"
