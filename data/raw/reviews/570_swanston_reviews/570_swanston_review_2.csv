"This student accommodation is just walking distance from RMIT University and The University of Melbourne. Which is really great especially for the convenience of the students who have to juggle a lot of different things during their Uni time.","Melisa","almost 2 years ago"
"The city centre is only close to 10 minutes away from this student housing option so you can easily grab a quick bite or shop around and maybe even see some of the local attractions that this place has to offer.","Rosa","almost 2 years ago"
