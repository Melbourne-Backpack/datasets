"Sped as in this joint???"
"Pros: Very good location, close proximity to public transports, groceries, restaurants and university. Receptionist and residential advisors are very kind and helpful. There are cleaners cleaning common area everyday.\n\nCons: Most of the facilities are rather old and constantly require maintenance. Rooms were quite spacious but have very thin walls and very bad sound proof. Good luck trying to get a good sleep if you have inconsiderate neighbour.\n\nConclusion: For the cheap price I was paying, I c"
"Honest review only. Based on my own experience. I hope this review can help you decide on your future stay.\n\nAug 2019: I've been enjoying this place and the people here are nice and friendly. Tram service just outside the unilodge and 15min walk to Melbourne Central. Student facilities such as table tennis, billiard, table football, ps4, TV on the living room, and more. Clean and comfortable place to live.\n\nJul 2020: After staying here for almost a year now, I've come to realize that every floor"
"Only rats with proof"
"Super friendly reception that care about residents. For the price its a great location. Rooms are great with a massive desk perfect for university and the added basin is a nice touch just keep in mind there are no aircons in the room. Kitchens are kept pretty clean by the cleaners, sometimes left a bit dirty and some areas are a bit dusty but nothing major. Elevators are a bit loud and one has been out of order for a while (but should hopefully get fixed sometimes soon). Outside areas are kept r"
"The building has banned visitors to enter this building. However, yesterday I saw a guy with a girl from outside (she did not look familiar to me so I asked where she lived when we encountered in the corridor, she said she was not the resident here). UniLodge does not have concrete policy to completely stop visitors to come in. How dangerous it is."
"I would give them 2—3 stars. Given the pest problem, the constant state of non cleanliness, the lifts constantly being broken and the management not dealing with these issues in a way that resolved them permanently. However, there was a real sense of community there — so I would still recommend it if you can deal with those things.\n\nBut given I saw 4 reviews from RAs that were working there at the time that they reviewed it — for 4 stars and for 5 stars, I’m giving them one star to balance it ou"
"Very convenient place"
"Friendly and helpful receptionist, staff and residents. Location just across the University Melbourne, short walk to popular Lygon st and Woolworths, and only a few tram stops away from Melbourne CBD. Clean and comfortable place to live. Worth the money!"
"Nice place for students accommodation near major universities"
"You can meet a lot of friendly people with the way the building is set up with a shared kitchen. The fortnightly barbeques and events are both really fun and well priced. The location is great and it's a great price for the proximity to university."
"If you are looking for rude customer services, dirty living environment, and expensive living fees, come and move in."
"I've spent my previous semester at UniLodge@Melbourne and I genuinely like the place. I've read all the other reviews and I guess I understand why people feel the way they do.\n\nFirstly, this is my own personal experience. I live on the 10th floor and I have an amazing view from my room. The room is great and I have no complaints. The bathroom is and has always been clean during my time here. The kitchens are brilliant. That being said, the cleanliness directly depends on how other floormates use"
"距离墨大很近，具有地理上的优势。可以遇见五湖四海的朋友。"
"Stay here if u like automatic closing doors that slam shut 24/7, mice, cockroaches, no AC except hearing the neighbouring buildings AC all day and night, filthy kitchens, rude reception staff and cleaners, windows in the hallways being left open that make that cause sub artic temperatures, heaters that are on power timers and dont stay on through the night, one of the lifts has been out of service for 3 months, showers with really rough pebbled flooring and hair. If still want to live here enjo"
"UniLodge has had pest problems (RATS, COCKROACHES AND BED BUGS) for YEARS. Their solution seems to be to ask employees to post fake reviews.\n\nDarisen Mootoosamy (Jason) and Viktor Chao who have posted are employees (RAs) at UniLodge.\n\nSee how dodgy this place is? They will even try to cheat you out of your bond by claiming non-existent damage to the sink.\n\nUniLodge is the Kingdom of the Rats. Bullying international students is what they do. Stay away.\n\n(If you still sign a contract after all the"
"It is so close to UniMelb and with a fair price. I love the weekly community events that push me out-door to explore the city with only $5.\nSome people do complaint about the mice issue but it never occurred to me even living here for 2 years now. I guess I am lucky and I am happy staying here."
"The environment is clean but there are mouses appear in the room sometimes"
"The activities organised by Unilodge are fun."
"Just saw a mice in my room. Disgusted, scared and helpless. I don't know where it went or how did it come inside. I'm new here and i already hate it"
"The staff is nice and the location is convenient, but there are mice everywhere (kitchen, rooms, hallways) and you see them again and again… the bathrooms and kitchen get too dirty often."
"Mice and cockroaches. In the kitchens. In your room. Mice and cockroaches. This has been a problem for years and years and they lie here saying that it is because of recent building works. Mice and cockroaches and lies. Mice and cockroaches and lies and filthy bathrooms and rude staff. Good lord I am glad my contract is ending this month."
"Mice everywhere. Overpriced accommodation, do yourself a favour and go elsewhere. Generally nice and friendly community of residents though."
"Been staying there for 6 months and can't wait to geto out. Money-wise, u can get a better place with the same money. Service bad."
"filthy place — mice in the kitchen"
"Low price always means the worst service. So I decided to leave, however even my checking out was a terrible experience! They said the 1252$'s refund would be returned in at most two weeks. Then after two weeks, they sent me a email to ask me if I agree to pay 120$'s cleaning fee, I was angry, why don't just claim that at the beginning? But I still replied that I agree. Another week later, they STILL didn't return back my money, I have to go back to union lodge and speak to them, now I have to w"
"staff is friendly but the place is filthy. not worth the rent"
"Dirty and dreadful"
"The only good part about this place is the proximity to The University of Melbourne. The staff at the reception are sometimes rude and the place is filled with rats and rodents."
"Worst place ever. Dirty and with rats and cockroaches. Dont waste your money here. You can get a better place with this rental rate."
"this place is the worst: they treat students very badly, toilets are always a mess, fire alarms are triggered on average once a month, vermin on all floors, regardless of season, yet they have the face to overcharge students, just because it is across Uni- not worth it."
"Before I moved to my unit, there was already a big hole in the ceiling of the bathroom. I had to go to tenan's union to get a letter to ask this lame company to fix the problem. It took over a month to get the job done. Even the worker was suprised about how serious the problem was and called this a bad workmenship. The other major problem was that the hot plate caused short circuit of the whole unit every time turned it on. It also took more than 1 month to be replaced with a new one. The whole"
