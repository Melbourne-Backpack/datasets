"The access to the wifi service was not easy to use. Apparently, it was prepared to be used through a computer more than from the phone or on the TV.\n\nThe apartment was very nice and comfortable. The heated swimming pool was fantastic!!! The staff was very friendly and always wiling to solve any problem that we had.\n\nStayed in January 2022"
"There was a bit of confusion when we were about to check-in. The staff told us that they're only giving us 1 room and if we want another one, we need to pay for it. I showed her the booking details and confirmation however, she was not convinced until I spoke with another staff and explained that I had booked for 2 rooms. Also, I forgot to check that there were no A/C in the room so we had to suffer in a 30+ degree in summer. Lol\n\nMovie room and pool. The room in the new building is clean.\n\nStayed in January 2022"
"Reception was a bit confusing. We arrived for check in around 8pm and had to call after hours to have someone come out to meet us, and when we left, there was no one in reception yet and no one answered the after hours call so check out was a bit confusing.\n\nThe pool and the gym were fantastic. The location was so convenient and close to the city. The little village was just so cute and clean aswell especially for affordable accommodation!\n\nStayed in January 2022"
"There was no dish washing liquid or cloths to clean dishes\n\nGreat location. Ease of checking in and out. Good value\n\nStayed in December 2021"
"Booking was made online but rang and spoke with mangers twice about the girls being 17 with no one over 18 staying with them. A couple of days before they were due to arrive an email was received to say they were cancelling the booking. After a phone discussion with the manager he reluctantly agreed to honour the booking. On arriving the girls were charged $11+ to use the Eftpos machine to pay for their stay and the bond. The room they were given was filthy and had no utensils, one pillow and the fridge didn't work. The key didn't work. After the first night they spoke with reception and she found them another room which was cleaner, had utensils, a toaster and a working fridge. Bond was received back after follow up emails.\n\nLocation was good.\n\nStayed in January 2022"
