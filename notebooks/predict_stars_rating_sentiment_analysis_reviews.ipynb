    "| ⭐  \t| A one-star rating often means a property has no frills and only offers basic accommodations. A one-star rating doesn’t necessarily mean an accomodation is dirty, unkept or in a bad location. It simply means you’ll have a place to sleep, and that’s pretty much it.  \t|\n",
    "| ⭐⭐  \t| Like one-star, two-star properties are typically more affordable than student living that have a higher rating — they are also usually quite comfortable.  \t|\n",
    "| ⭐⭐⭐  \t| Three-star student living ordinarily have some unique amenities and provide quality service.  \t|\n",
    "| ⭐⭐⭐⭐  \t| Four-star student living are often noted for their upscale quality and extraordinary comfort.  \t|\n",
    "| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  \t| A five-star property provides flawless guest services in a state-of-the-art facility. As a five-star property, such as premium dining options and personalized services to its students. With no detail being overlooked, these student living commonly even provides high-end, luxury toiletries for students.  \t|"
